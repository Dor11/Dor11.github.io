 <h1><b> My Pet </b> </h1>
 
 <P> my cat's name is "tutti", she is 7 years old and live in Israel with my family. 
We decided to adopt tutti 5 years ago because my brother wanted to have a pet and tutti has'nt have home. In addition, they had a good connection. 
We like to play with tutti and to take care of her. Tutti is part of the family.  </p>
